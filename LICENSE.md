The licensing of files in this repository is a bit complicated, since almost all subdirectories have different license statuses.

- libv2 (V2 synth core & RONAN), V2 Winamp plugin, and several other utilities are contained in source files in this directory and the subdirectories "conv2m", "in_v2m", "libv2", and "tool".
	- Placed in the public domain by Tammo "kb" Hinrichs.
	- Original notice at "<stuffs/LICENSE.txt>".
- v2player is added to the repository as a standalone utility for .v2m file playback. Its source code is in the "v2player" subdirectory.
	- I, Eric Zhang (<https://github.com/EZForever>), hereby place the source code of v2player in the public domain.
- V2 synth plugins for Buzz and VSTi, as well as the (probably deprecated) v2standalone utility, are in the subdirectories "v2buzz", "v2edit", "v2standalone", and "v2vsti".
	- Tammo "kb" Hinrichs failed to mention these subdirectories in the original license notice, thus the accurate license status is unknown.
	- README of the plugins' (former) binary releases contains a license notice: "<stuffs/README_PLUGIN.txt>"
	- libv2's (former) "semi-binary" releases are under Artistic License 2.0: "<stuffs/LICENSE_LIBV2.txt>"
