The original project for v2edit.dle (vsti/vsti.vcxproj) mentions a couple of missing files:
    <ClCompile Include="..\kram\e2p\english.c" />
    <ClCompile Include="..\kram\e2p\parse.c" />
    <ClCompile Include="..\kram\e2p\phoneme.c" />
    <ClCompile Include="..\kram\e2p\saynum.c" />
    <ClCompile Include="..\kram\e2p\spellwor.c" />

Base on some Internet searches I assume it is the "english2phoneme" package.
The website for this package is still online: http://svr-www.eng.cam.ac.uk/comp.speech/Section5/Synth/text.phoneme.3.html
However unfortunately the download link (to a FTP site) is broken.

Copies of the package sources can be seen all over GitHub, e.g. https://github.com/mattyoung101/LESS/tree/ca5508e/resources/english2phoneme
All the files in this directory is directly taken from that repository except "parse2.c".
The implementation of "e2p_initio" and "e2p_main" is not in the sources (probably added by kb). I made one up in "parse2.c" (modifying "parse.c"), and it seems to work identically with the official build.

As noted by John A. Wasser in the README file, this package is in public domain.
Note that this is K&R C, which is super old and MSVC complains quite a lot when compiling it.
